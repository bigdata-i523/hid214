    title: Big Data and Basketball
    abstract: >
        When players shoot the ball, the movement trajectory could
        decide the shooting rate directly. Theoretical basis of
        kinematic mechanics can contribute to analyze the influence of
        rotation of basketball on air resistance.

    title: Comparison between different classification algorithms in Digit Recognizer
    abstract: >
        Nowadays, Digit Recognizer is becoming more and more important in many 
        different areas, such as zip code recognizer, banking receipt and balance 
        sheet. Many technology companies are trying to use Big Data to develop 
        more efficient and accurate algorithm for Digit Recognizer. This project 
        uses Digit Recognizer dataset from Kaggle.com. There are more than 42000 samples 
        in the Dataset. Different algorithms such as kth nearest neighbor (KNN), 
        logistic regression and DNN (deep neural network) will be implemented on 
        Digit Recognizer. The performance will be compared with the different size of 
        data and different algorithm.
